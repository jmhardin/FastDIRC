to build.  Root should be the only dependency right now.

for a sample run try:

     ./dircfit -n <number of events> -E <Energy in GeV> -particle_theta <theta> -particle_phi <phi>

     ./dircfit -n 1000 -E 4.5 -particle_theta 4 -particle_phi 20
     
This is "loop" mode and will run very quickly - the KDE is only simulated once.
This will produce "fitdirc.root".  This can be changed with the -of option.
There are also a lot of command line options to perturb the box geometry, they can be viewed in the source.

A signifigantly paired down driver file is also provided under example_driver/ - type:

	make example

to build it.  It accepts a subset of the commands of the regular file.  It also does not contain the experimental algorithms and input methods and so should be signifigantly easier to read.


To read from a csv file, use -if foo.csv

it expects the format:

Event_NUM PID_NUM BAR x_mm y_mm time_ns theta_deg phi_deg Energy_GeV

where event_num comes from the Montecarlo and pid is the geant PID.  Bar is an indexing of the bars from the middle.  1 is the closest bar to the beam on the right, with 24 being the furthest right bar.  -1 to -24 behave similarly on the left.  x and y are mm counts from the middle of the bar (NOT absolute coordinates).

Use can use the command flag "-force_kinematics" to overide the last 3 colums.  Note that force kinematics will override them even if no other options are passed, as they have default values.

The flag -t <ns> will cause events which are marked with a timestamp within that number of ns to produce hits on the PMT plane and "confound" the results.  Useful for testing windows and backgrounds.  Defaults to -1.

To fit a resolution, rung graphicHistos.C(<file>,bool verbose, double Energy (GeV)) on the rootfile output from the simulation.
