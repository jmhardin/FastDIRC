1) Unpack goptical 1.0 (I used the one updated 07-Jan-2012)

2) Replace the file in goptical_core/src/sys_system.cc with the one in this directory
	This one is changed so that the index_get function correctly indexes objects after an object is removed from the system.  Failing to replace this will cause this code to segfault.

3) Build and install goptical

4) Make sure the goptical_core/src/.libs/libgoptical-1.0.so is in your ld path (I had to edit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ to add it and then run ldconfig)

5) Edit the Makefile to correctly point to that library
